        And coffee needs people and nature to thrive. Discover how the Sustainable Coffee Challenge is changing lives and making your morning cup better in the process.
    </p>
  body_text_intro: |-
    <p>
        The coffee we drink depends on the health, prosperity and well-being of 25 million coffee producers, 10 million hectares of coffee farms, and the continued ability of nature to sustain both.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sustainable Coffee Challenge is a collaborative effort of companies, governments, NGOs, research institutions and others to address challenges head on and transition coffee to a fully sustainable sector. Challenge partners are working together with urgency to increase transparency, align around a common vision for sustainability and collaborate to accelerate progress towards those goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        As 195 governments united to sign and commit to action at the 2015 UN Paris Climate Change Conference, Conservation International (CI) announced the formation of the Sustainable Coffee Challenge. Conceived by Conservation International and Starbucks, the Challenge was launched with 18 diverse stakeholders dedicated to coffee sustainability. The movement has since grown to more than <a href="/partners">80 international partners</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Challenge is facilitated by Conservation International, with the agenda and actions led by Challenge partners. Together, these change makers work to find solutions for the coffee community.

    We will have achieved our vision when all coffee is produced meeting
    sustainable practices
  body_text_1: |-
    <p>
        These sustainable practices will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure coffee contributes to improved income and profitability for the 25 million coffee producers, workers and their families.
        </li>
        <li>Implement sustainable agricultural practices to triple productivity on the existing 10 million hectares of coffee to sustain supply and enable the sector to meet rising consumption and the growing demand for coffee in a socially and environmentally responsible way.
        </li>
        <li>Prevent the clearing of one additional hectare of high conservation-value forest or depleting other natural resources for enhanced coffee production.
        </li>
    </ul>

  subhead_3: Shedding Light on Commitments
  body_text_3: |-
    <p>
        The Challenge hosts a place for stakeholders to publicly state their commitments to sustainability and report on progress over time. By shedding light on commitments made by stakeholders throughout the sector, we can better leverage them to form new partnerships and inspire others to act. While <a href="/commitments">the coffee sector has invested heavily in sustainability for decades</a>, we recognize that the complex issues facing the sector require a wide range of solutions and commitments. Still, it is hard to know who is doing what and who our allies and partners might be. Transparency of sustainability commitments means stating them in a shared space and reporting on progress. <a href="/start-a-commitment">Start tracking your journey</a>.<br>
    </p>
  subhead_4: A Guiding Compass
  body_text_4: |-
    <p>
        Although great progress has been made in the last 20 years, the sector lacks a clear and common understanding of what we mean by sustainability. The Sustainable Coffee Challenge has developed a definition of success for the sector, with long-term goals, as part of a broader sustainability framework designed to show how our individual initiatives ladder up into a collective effort to transform the sector. <a href="/framework">See how your contribution fits into the greater whole</a>.
    </p>
  subhead_5: Sparking Action
  body_text_5: |-
    <p>
        At the Challenge, we wish to spark further collaboration across the sector toward <a href="http://sustaincoffee.org">collective goals</a>. We believe that collective action is vital to accelerate the movement and achieve our vision. It takes all of us to get to scale. <a href="http://sustaincoffee.org">We can't stop here</a>.
    </p>
  subhead_6: Join the Challenge
  body_text_6: |-
    <p>
        We all have a role to play. By uniting industry, governments, nonprofit organizations and others, we can tackle the complex issues facing coffee and ensure the long-term supply.

    </p>
    <p>

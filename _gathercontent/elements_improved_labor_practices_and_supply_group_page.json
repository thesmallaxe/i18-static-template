Climate change, diseases and volatile coffee prices disrupt labor flows and affect long-term supply of labor to coffee farms — potentially leading to more incidents of child and forced labor in the coffee sector if we are not able to develop both short and long-term solutions. By improving labor conditions, we can reduce the reputational risk to the sector, set an example for the broader agricultural sector and attract new investments to coffee.\n</p>","subhead_1":"Our Collective Goal","body_text_1":"<p>\n    A coffee sector in which forced labor and child labor are eradicated, and in which working conditions enable all workers involved in coffee production to prosper.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Network will share knowledge on best practices to improve farmer prosperity, create a Guidance Document based on case studies and successful models, and develop a pre-competitive tool to assess labor risks in producing countries.\n</p>","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_1":"","2_column_bulleted_list_1":"","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_1":"","subhead_2":"Why it Matters","body_text_2":"<p>\n    Coffee presents an economic development opportunity for many communities across the tropics — but it must benefit the entire community, including workers who arrive during the harvest to pick the coffee. Addressing labor conditions is critical, yet probably one of the greatest challenges — not just for coffee but for the entire agricultural sector and it will take all of us to tackle it head on.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Identifying the root causes of poor labor practices and the barriers to overcome them is essential to for thriving coffee communities. This network will engage in multi-stakeholder dialogues to assess the problems and identify long-term solutions.\n</p>","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_2":"Collective Action Network Members","2_column_bulleted_list_2":"<ol>\n    <li>Arizona State University*\n    </li>\n    <li>Boncafe International*\n    </li>\n    <li>Cafedirect Producers' Foundation\n    </li>\n    <li>Caffe Ibis Coffee Roasting Co.*\n    </li>\n    <li>Catholic Relief Services\n    </li>\n    <li>Conservation International*\n    </li>\n    <li>Counter Culture Coffee*\n    </li>\n    <li>Fair Trade America*\n    </li>\n    <li>Fairtrade International\n    </li>\n    <li>Fairtrade USA*\n    </li>\n    <li>Farmer Brothers*\n    </li>\n    <li>Gavina\n    </li>\n    <li>Hanns R Neumann Stiftung (HRNS)*\n    </li>\n    <li>Keurig Green Mountain*\n    </li>\n    <li>Lutheran World Relief\n    </li>\n    <li>nuJava Coffee Company*\n    </li>\n    <li>Rainforest Alliance*\n    </li>\n    <li>RGC Coffee\n    </li>\n    <li>SCAN*\n    </li>\n    <li>SCS Global Services\n    </li>\n    <li>Solidaridad*\n    </li>\n    <li>Specialty Coffee Association*\n    </li>\n    <li>Starbucks*\n    </li>\n    <li>TechnoServe*\n    </li>\n    <li>True Roots\n    </li>\n    <li>Tuungane Women's Coffee Cooperative*\n    </li>\n    <li>United Farm Workers\n    </li>\n    <li>UTZ*\n    </li>\n    <li>Verite\n    </li>\n    <li>Vigilante Coffee*\n    </li>\n</ol>","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_2":"*Denotes Sustainable Coffee Challenge partner","subhead_3":"","body_text_3":"","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_3":"Key terms:","2_column_bulleted_list_3":"<ul>\n    <li>\n        <em>Child Labor</em>: Work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <em>F</em><em>orced Labor or Compulsory Labor</em>: All work or service which is exacted from any person under the threat of a penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.\n    </li>\n</ul>","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_3":"","subhead_4":"","body_text_4":"","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_4":"","2_column_bulleted_list_4":"","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_4":"","subhead_5":"","body_text_5":"","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_5":"","2_column_bulleted_list_5":"","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_5":"","subhead_6":"","body_text_6":"","2_column_bulleted_list_heading_6":"","2_column_bulleted_list_6":"","2_column_bulleted_list_footer_6":""},"inline_images_and_video":{"asset_1_type":[],"asset_1_caption":"","asset_2_type":[],"asset_2_caption":"","asset_3_type":[],"asset_3_caption":""},"inline_quotes_excerpts":{"quote_excerpt_1":"","quote_excerpt_1_attribution":"","quote_excerpt_2":"","quote_excerpt_2_attribution":"","quote_excerpt_3":"","quote_excerpt_3_attribution":""},"resources_box":{"resources_box_headline":"Resources","resource_1_name":"Download the Action Plan","resource_2_name":"Find more tools here","resource_3_name":""}}

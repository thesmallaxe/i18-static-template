How close are we now? What else is needed? What can I do?\n</p>\n<p>\n    These are all questions the coffee sector is asking. Sustainability can be confusing. We use the word to mean so many different things — strengthening market demand, improving producers' livelihoods, conserving nature, sustaining supply. And we often approach it from different starting points and with different lenses.\n</p>\n<p>\n    What if we could see how our individual contributions added up to sector-wide impacts? This is the purpose of the Framework — to provide a collective vision for the sector, a definition of success we can all stand behind and a compass to guide us along the journey. The Framework shows how each action, each path has the ability to make a meaningful contribution towards our ambitious vision. It is also designed to provide guidance to those considering new interventions.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The framework consists of five key components: a common definition of success, a guiding compass, 15 intervention pathways, common impacts and outcomes and a common theory of change showing how the pieces add up to a collective whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It was developed by the Sustainable Coffee Challenge partners together with the Global Coffee Platform as part of an inclusive and consultative process. The sustainability journey is ever changing, as are the challenges facing the sector. We expect the framework to adapt and grow over time to meet these changing needs and to guide our actions in making coffee the world's first sustainable agricultural product.\n</p>","subhead_1":"","body_text_1":"","subhead_2":"","body_text_2":"","subhead_3":"Our Actions Matter","body_text_3":"<p>\n    We all have a role to play in the transition to a sustainable coffee sector.

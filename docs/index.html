  The world is changing rapidly, across urban and rural areas. Growing demand for food – driven by population increase and rising incomes – is creating opportunities and challenges for people working in rural areas, including in smallholder agriculture and in the non-farm economy.
</p>
<p>
  Rising agricultural productivity, more jobs off the farm and migration to cities are reshaping rural life – but so too are adverse factors such as climate change, environmental degradation and other risks.
</p>
<p>
  Small farms continue to provide livelihoods for up to 2.5 billion people and account for up to 80 per cent of food produced in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In a fast-changing world, rural areas must transform - and rapidly - in order to be sustainably included in growing economies and to contribute to overall prosperity.

  Over the past quarter century, the reduction in poverty levels has been striking. In 1990, some 44 per cent of people in developing regions lived on less than US$1.90/day.  By 2012, that proportion had fallen to 14.9 per cent, which represents over 1 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty. Most of the improvement was in Asia and the Pacific region. The most limited progress has been achieved in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, poverty levels in rural areas of most regions remain well above those in urban areas.
</p>
<p>
  Rural development is one of the most effective ways to overcome rural poverty and to reduce the gap between rural and urban realities. Rural development has a direct impact on incomes and food and nutrition security. It also affects quality of life through improved education, healthcare and other critical services.
</p>
<p>
  The introduction looks at the driving forces. It explores the connection between national economic development and rural transformation, and the links between city and farm. It also looks at the way in which governments and others can ensure that poor and marginalized rural dwellers are not left behind in the process.

  Why doesn’t rapid structural change always go hand in hand with fast poverty reduction?
</p>
<p>
  The Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries of Latin America and the Caribbean underwent a vast rural transformation in the second half of the 20th Century. By the year 2000, some 75 per cent of people lived in towns and cities, and agriculture’s share of GDP had fallen by 40 per cent since 1980 to little more than five per cent of the region’s economy.
</p>
<p>
  Rural economies have diversified, and rural roads and communications technologies have blurred the cultural distance between rural and urban youth. Rural-urban territories have sprung up, centred on small towns and villages, creating new types of rural societies in which agriculture is still important, but no longer dominates the economic landscape. Yet there are still an estimated 15 million family farms.
